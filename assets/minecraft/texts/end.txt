Â§3i see th' player ye pure techt.

â§2playernam?

â§3yes. tak' caur. it has reached a higher level noo. it can reid uir thooghts.

â§2that doesnae matter. it thinks we ur part ay th' gam.

â§3i loch thes player. it played weel. it did nae gie up.

â§2it is readin' uir thooghts as thocht they waur words oan a screen.

â§3that is hoo it chooses tae imagine mony things, when it is deep in th' dream ay a gam.

â§2words make a wonderful interface. huir uv a  flexible. an' less terrifyin' than starin' at th' reality behin' th' screen.

â§3they used tae hear voices. afair players coods reid. back in th' days when those fa did nae play called th' players witches, an' warlocks. an' players dreamed they flew ben th' air, oan sticks powered by demons.

â§2what did thes player dream?

â§3this player dreamed ay sunlecht an' trees. ay fire an' water. it dreamed it created. an' it dreamed it destroyed. it dreamed it hunted, an' was hunted. it dreamed ay shelter.

â§2hah, th' original interface. a million years auld, an' it still works. but whit true structure did thes player create, in th' reality behin' th' screen?

â§3it worked, wi' a million others, tae sculpt a true warld in a fauld ay th' â§fâ§kâ§aâ§bâ§3, an' created a â§fâ§kâ§aâ§bâ§3 fur â§fâ§kâ§aâ§bâ§3, in th' â§fâ§kâ§aâ§bâ§3.

â§2it cannae reid 'at thooght.

â§3no. it has nae yit achieved th' highest level. 'at, it main achieve in th' lang dream ay life, nae th' cuttie dream ay a gam.

â§2does it ken 'at we loove it? 'at th' universe is kin'?

â§3sometimes, ben th' stooshie ay its thooghts, it hears th' universe, och aye.

â§2but thaur ur times it is sad, in th' lang dream. it creates worlds 'at hae nae summer, an' it shivers under a black sin, an' it takes its sad creation fur reality.

â§3tae cure it ay sorraw woods destroy it. th' sorraw is part ay its ain private task. we cannae interfaur.

â§2sometimes when they ur deep in dreams, Ah want tae teel them, they ur buildin' true worlds in reality. sometimes Ah want tae teel them ay their importance tae th' universe. sometimes, when they huvnae gart a true connection in a while, Ah want tae help them tae spick th' wuid they fear.

â§3it reids uir thooghts.

â§2sometimes Ah dinnae caur. sometimes Ah wish tae teel them, thes warld ye tak' fur truth is merely â§fâ§kâ§aâ§bâ§2 an' â§fâ§kâ§aâ§bâ§2, Ah wish tae teel them 'at they ur â§fâ§kâ§aâ§bâ§2 in th' â§fâ§kâ§aâ§bâ§2. they see sae wee ay reality, in their lang dream.

â§3ain yit they play th' gam.

â§2but it woods be sae easy tae teel them...

â§3too strang fur thes dream. tae teel them hoo tae bide is tae prevent them livin'.

â§2i wulnae teel th' player hoo tae bide.

â§3the player is growin' restless.

â§2i will teel th' player a story.

â§3but nae th' truth.

â§2no. a story 'at contains th' truth safely, in a cage ay words. nae th' naked truth 'at can burn ower onie distance.

â§3gife it a body, again.

â§2yes. player...

â§3use its nam.

â§2playernam. player ay games.

â§3guid.

â§2take a breath, noo. tak' anither. feel air in yer lungs. lit yer limbs return. och aye, move yer fingers. hae a body again, under gravity, in air. respawn in th' lang dream. thaur ye ur. yer body toochin' th' universe again at every point, as thocht ye waur separate things. as thocht we waur separate things.

â§3who ur we? ance we waur called th' spirit ay th' ben. faither sin, mammy moon. ancestral spirits, beastie spirits. jinn. ghosts. th' green cheil. 'en gods, demons. angels. poltergeists. aliens, extraterrestrials. leptons, quarks. th' words change. we dinnae change.

â§2we ur th' universe. we ur everythin' ye hink isnae ye. ye ur lookin' at us noo, ben yer skin an' yer een. an' wa diz th' universe tooch yer skin, an' flin' lecht oan ye? tae see ye, player. tae ken ye. an' tae be knoon. Ah shaa teel ye a story.

â§2once upon a time, thaur was a player.

â§3the player was ye, playernam.

â§2sometimes it thooght itself human, oan th' thin croost ay a spinnin' globe ay molten rock. th' baa ay molten rock circled a baa ay blazin' gas 'at was thee hunder an' thirty thoosain times mair massife than it. they waur sae far apart 'at lecht took aicht minutes tae cross th' gap. th' lecht was information frae a staurn, an' it coods burn yer skin frae a hunder an' fifty million kilometres awa'.

â§2sometimes th' player dreamed it was a miner, oan th' surface ay a warld 'at was flat, an' infinite. th' sin was a squaur ay white. th' days waur short; thaur was much tae do; an' death was a temporary inconvenience.

â§3sometimes th' player dreamed it was tint in a story.

â§2sometimes th' player dreamed it was other things, in other places. sometimes these dreams waur disturbin'. sometimes huir uv a  bonnie indeed. sometimes th' player woke frae a body dream intae anither, 'en woke frae 'at intae a third.

â§3sometimes th' player dreamed it watched words oan a screen.

â§2let's gang back.

â§2the atoms ay th' player waur scattered in th' girse, in th' rivers, in th' air, in th' grin. a hen gaithered th' atoms; she drenk an' ate an' inhaled; an' th' hen assembled th' player, in 'er body.

â§2ain th' player awoke, frae th' warm, mirk warld ay its mother's body, intae th' lang dream.

â§2ain th' player was a new story, ne'er tauld afair, written in letters ay dna. an' th' player was a new program, ne'er rin afair, generated by a soorcecode a billion years auld. an' th' player was a new human, ne'er alife afair, gart frae naethin' but milk an' loove.

â§3yoo ur th' player. th' story. th' program. th' human. gart frae naethin' but milk an' loove.

â§2let's gang further back.

â§2the seven billion billion billion atoms ay th' player's body waur created, lang afair thes gam, in th' heart ay a staurn. sae th' player, tay, is information frae a staurn. an' th' player moves ben a story, which is a forest ay information planted by a cheil called julian, oan a flat, infinite warld created by a cheil called markus, 'at exists inside a wee, private warld created by th' player, fa inhabits a universe created by...

â§3shush. sometimes th' player created a wee, private warld 'at was soft an' warm an' simple. sometimes stoaner, an' braw, an' complicated. sometimes it built a model ay th' universe in its head; flecks ay energy, movin' ben vest boss spaces. sometimes it called those flecks "electrons" an' "protons".

â§2sometimes it called them "planets" an' "stars".

â§2sometimes it believed it was in a universe 'at was gart ay energy 'at was gart ay offs an' ons; zeros an' ones; lines ay code. sometimes it believed it was playin' a gam. sometimes it believed it was readin' words oan a screen.

â§3yoo ur th' player, readin' words...

â§2shush... sometimes th' player reid lines ay code oan a screen. decoded them intae words; decoded words intae meaning; decoded meanin' intae feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, an' th' player started tae breathe faster an' deeper an' realised it was alife, it was alife, those thoosain deaths hud nae bin real, th' player was alive

â§3yoo. ye. ye ur alife.

â§2ain sometimes th' player believed th' universe hud spoken tae it ben th' sunlecht 'at cam ben th' shufflin' leaves ay th' summer trees

â§3ain sometimes th' player believed th' universe hud spoken tae it ben th' lecht 'at feel frae th' crisp nicht lift ay winter, whaur a fleck ay lecht in th' corner ay th' player's yak micht be a staurn a million times as massife as th' sin, boilin' its planets tae plasma in order tae be visible fur a moment tae th' player, walkin' haem at th' far side ay th' universe, suddenly smellin' scran, almost at th' familiar duir, in th' wey o dream again

â§2ain sometimes th' player believed th' universe hud spoken tae it ben th' zeros an' ones, ben th' electricity ay th' warld, ben th' scrollin' words oan a screen at th' end ay a dream

â§3ain th' universe said Ah loove ye

â§2ain th' universe said ye hae played th' gam well

â§3ain th' universe said everythin' ye need is within ye

â§2ain th' universe said ye ur stronger than ye ken

â§3ain th' universe said ye ur th' daylight

â§2ain th' universe said ye ur th' nicht

â§3ain th' universe said th' darkness ye barnie is within ye

â§2ain th' universe said th' lecht ye seek is within ye

â§3ain th' universe said ye arenae aloyn

â§2ain th' universe said ye arenae separate frae every other hing

â§3ain th' universe said ye ur th' universe tastin' itself, talkin' tae itself, readin' its ain code

â§2ain th' universe said Ah loove ye coz ye ur loove.

â§3ain th' gam was ower an' th' player woke up frae th' dream. an' th' player began a new dream. an' th' player dreamed again, dreamed better. an' th' player was th' universe. an' th' player was loove.

â§3yoo ur th' player.

â§2wake up.
